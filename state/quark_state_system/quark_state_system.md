# 🧠 QUARK STATE SYSTEM - MAIN INDEX

**Purpose**: Central hub for all QUARK state information  
**Architecture**: Modular design following cursor rules (50-150 lines per file)

---

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

**Live Status**: [Current Status & Progress](current_status.md)  
*Dynamically generated from active roadmap files*

**Key Metrics**:
- Active Roadmaps: 1 (Stage 1 Embryonic)
- In-Progress Tasks: 16
- Current Focus: Neural tube development and brain region primordia

---

## 🗺️ **ROADMAP & DEVELOPMENT**

**Development History**: [Development History](development_history.md)  
*Complete record of completed phases and milestones*

**Current Roadmap Focus**:
- **Stage 1**: Embryonic Development (📋 In Progress)
- **Stage 2-6**: Planned developmental stages

---

## 🔗 **SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS** 

**Integration Status**: [Integration Status](integration_status.md)  
*Brain systems, cloud infrastructure, and testing frameworks*

**Key Integrations**:
- Brain simulation modules
- AWS cloud services (S3, Braket, Bedrock)
- Testing and validation frameworks

---

## 🚀 **USAGE & COMMANDS**

**Complete Usage Guide**: [Usage Guide](usage_guide.md)  
*Commands, workflows, and troubleshooting*

**Quick Commands**:
   ```bash
python QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py status          # Live status
python QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py recommendations # Current tasks
python QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py list-tasks      # All tasks with IDs
```

---

## 🎯 **TASK MANAGEMENT**

**Active Tasks**: Generated from live roadmap files  
**Structure**: Phase → Batch → Step → P/F/A/O (sprint-batch-task-management)  
**Files**: 
- `in-progress_tasks.yaml` - All active tasks
- `tasks_archive.yaml` - Completed tasks

**Workflow**:
1. Tasks extracted from roadmaps marked "📋 In Progress"
2. Organized by original sub-headings and sprint structure
3. Completed tasks moved to archive with roadmap DONE tags

---

## 🔄 **AUTOMATIC UPDATES**

**Dynamic Generation**: All status information generated from live data  
**No Static Content**: System ignores legacy documentation  
**Archive Exclusion**: Never scans backup/archive folders unless requested

**Update Triggers**:
- Every recommendations/tasks request
- Status checks
- Task completion operations

---

## 📁 **MODULAR ARCHITECTURE**

This state system follows modular design principles:

- **[current_status.md](current_status.md)** (50 lines) - Live status and progress
- **[integration_status.md](integration_status.md)** (80 lines) - System integrations  
- **[development_history.md](development_history.md)** (90 lines) - Completed milestones
- **[usage_guide.md](usage_guide.md)** (120 lines) - Commands and workflows

**Total**: 340 lines across 4 focused files (was 454 lines in single file)

---

*This modular state system ensures maintainability while preserving all functionality.*  
*Each module focuses on a specific aspect of QUARK's state management.*
