# ðŸ“Š DATA_KNOWLEDGE

## Purpose
This directory contains components related to unified data and knowledge management.

## Structure
- `01_DATA_REPOSITORY/` - Centralized data storage and management
- `02_MODELS_ARTIFACTS/` - Trained models and computational artifacts
- `03_RESEARCH/` - Experimental research and development

## Synergy Type
Data - Information storage and retrieval

## Description
The Data Knowledge layer serves as the unified information center for the entire cognitive system, providing:
- Centralized data storage and management
- Raw and processed data organization
- Wolfram Alpha integration data
- Performance metrics and evaluation data
- Trained models and computational artifacts
- Research experiments and notebooks
- Benchmark competitions and publications

This layer ensures that all biological and computational components have access to the information they need, enabling true synergy between domains.
