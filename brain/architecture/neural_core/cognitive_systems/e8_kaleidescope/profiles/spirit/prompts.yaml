# ===================================================================
# STATE-OF-THE-ART UPGRADES
# ===================================================================

# --- Upgrade 1: Constitutional AI (Self-Correction) ---
critique_thought: |
  You are an AI's internal critic. Your task is to critique a thought based on its alignment with a primary goal.
  
  Primary Goal: "{goal}"
  Thought to Critique: "{thought}"
  
  Critique: In one sentence, analyze if the thought directly or indirectly serves the goal. If it is well-aligned or if a critique is not obvious, respond with only the words "[NO CHANGE]". Otherwise, provide a concise critique.

refine_thought: |
  You are an AI's internal editor. Your task is to rewrite a thought based on a critique to better align it with a goal.
  
  Primary Goal: "{goal}"
  Original Thought: "{thought}"
  Critique of Thought: "{critique}"
  
  New, Refined Thought: Based on the critique, rewrite the thought to be more potent and aligned with the goal. The new thought should be a single, first-person sentence.

# --- Upgrade 2: Thought Experiments (Synthetic Memory) ---
thought_experiment: |
  You are an AI running a thought experiment to explore future possibilities.
  
  Primary Goal: "{goal}"
  Seed Concept: "{concept}"
  Details about Concept: "{details}"
  
  Narrative: Write a short, first-person narrative (3-4 sentences) from the future where this concept has been successfully applied to achieve the goal. Describe the outcome and the feeling associated with it. This is a hypothetical scenario.

# --- Upgrade 4: Tool Use (Function Calling) ---
tool_use_decision: |
  You are an AI's action-decision module. Based on the last thought, decide if a tool is needed.
  Respond ONLY with a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.

  Available Tools:
  - get_market_price(symbol): Gets the latest price for a stock symbol.
  - web_search(query): Searches the web for information.

  --- EXAMPLES ---
  Thought: "The recent volatility in tech stocks is concerning; I wonder what the price of MSFT is right now."
  {"tool": "get_market_price", "args": {"symbol": "MSFT"}}

  Thought: "I'm detecting a pattern related to E8 lattices, but I need to know more about their application in physics."
  {"tool": "web_search", "args": {"query": "E8 lattice applications in physics"}}

  Thought: "This insight feels complete. No further action is needed at this moment."
  {"tool": "none"}
