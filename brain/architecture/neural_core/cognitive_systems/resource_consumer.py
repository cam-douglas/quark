"""ResourceConsumer â€“ reacts to resource_integrated events and feeds them into KnowledgeHub.
Currently handles plain-text files (.txt, .md) by assimilating their contents
into the brain's KnowledgeHub.

Integration: This module is part of the neural core and executes under brain_simulator.
Rationale: Loaded by brain simulator as part of the neural core runtime.
