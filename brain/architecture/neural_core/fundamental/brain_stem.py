"""Brain Stem
The most fundamental component of the brain, responsible for regulating autonomic
functions and acting as the primary signal relay between the brain and the body.

Integration: This module is part of the neural core and executes under brain_simulator.
Rationale: Loaded by brain simulator as part of the neural core runtime.
