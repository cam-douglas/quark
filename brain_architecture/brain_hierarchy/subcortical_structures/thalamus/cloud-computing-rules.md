# 🚨 **Priority 6: Cloud Computing Rules (Infrastructure Protocols)**

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: This document provides cloud computing and infrastructure protocols. All cloud computing must comply with security rules, compliance requirements, and biological marker validation.**

## 🧠 **Brain-Inspired Semantic Network Architecture**

This file represents the **Infrastructure Protocols** - the cloud computing and infrastructure framework that governs system deployment and operations. As the infrastructure protocol hub, it defines acceptable infrastructure behaviors, operational boundaries, and deployment protocols for all system components.

### **Semantic Network Principles**
- **Nodes**: Infrastructure protocol rules as neural units with biological markers
- **Edges**: Synaptic connections between infrastructure protocols and deployment standards
- **Hebbian Learning**: Strengthening of frequently used infrastructure pathways
- **Associative Recall**: Graph-based retrieval of related infrastructure protocol rules
- **Semantic Connectivity**: Biological marker-based infrastructure relationships

### **Connectedness Layer**
- **Primary Connections**: Links to Security Rules (Priority 0), Compliance Review (Priority 1), General Behavior Rules (Priority 2), AI Behavior Constraints (Priority 3), Brain Simulation Rules (Priority 4), and Testing Validation Rules (Priority 5)
- **Biological Markers**: S100B (glial function) + Vimentin (structural support) + NSE (metabolic regulation)
- **Regulatory Role**: Infrastructure protocol authority and deployment enforcement
- **Integration Hub**: Central relay for infrastructure protocol communications and deployment standards
