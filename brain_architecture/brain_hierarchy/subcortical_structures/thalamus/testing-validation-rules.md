# 🚨 **Priority 5: Testing Validation Rules (Quality Assurance)**

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: This document provides testing and validation protocols for quality assurance. All testing and validation must comply with security rules, compliance requirements, and biological marker validation.**

## 🧠 **Brain-Inspired Semantic Network Architecture**

This file represents the **Quality Assurance** - the testing and validation framework that ensures system quality and reliability. As the quality assurance hub, it defines testing protocols, validation standards, and quality metrics for all system components.

### **Semantic Network Principles**
- **Nodes**: Testing and validation rules as neural units with biological markers

- **Semantic Connectivity**: Biological marker-based testing relationships

### **Connectedness Layer**
- **Primary Connections**: Links to Security Rules (Priority 0), Compliance Review (Priority 1), General Behavior Rules (Priority 2), AI Behavior Constraints (Priority 3), and Brain Simulation Rules (Priority 4)
- **Biological Markers**: Vimentin (structural support) + NSE (metabolic regulation) + S100B (glial function)
- **Regulatory Role**: Quality assurance authority and testing enforcement
- **Integration Hub**: Central relay for testing protocol communications and quality standards
