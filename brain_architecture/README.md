# ðŸ§  BRAIN_ARCHITECTURE

## Purpose
This directory contains components related to biological brain simulation and neural processes.

## Structure
- `01_NEURAL_CORE/` - Core neural modules and brain functions
- `02_BRAIN_HIERARCHY/` - Multi-scale brain organization

## Synergy Type
Biological - Direct mapping to biological neural structures

## Description
The Brain Architecture represents the biological foundation of the cognitive system, simulating real neural processes including:
- Sensory processing and filtering
- Cognitive functions and consciousness
- Memory formation and consolidation
- Motor control and learning
- Specialized neural networks
- Evolutionary adaptation

Each component maps directly to biological brain structures and functions, providing the foundation for biological-computational synergy.
