# ðŸš€ QUARK: A Self-Determined, Biologically-Compliant AGI Framework

QUARK is a modular brain-simulation and AGI framework that is now managed by an **autonomous, roadmap-driven core**. The system is designed to evolve according to a series of strategic roadmaps while strictly adhering to biological and safety constraints defined by the AlphaGenome integration.

---

## ðŸ¤– **New Operational Mode: The Quark Active Driver**

**The Quark system is now in a continuous, self-determined execution mode.**

All interactions and development are orchestrated by the **Quark Driver** (`quark_state_system/quark_driver.py`), a new core component that ensures every action is aligned with the project's strategic goals.

### How It Works:
1.  **Roadmap-Driven**: The system's primary directive comes from a unified understanding of all project roadmaps (`management/rules/roadmap/`).
2.  **Biologically Compliant**: Every action is validated by a **Compliance Engine** (`brain_modules/alphagenome_integration/compliance_engine.py`) to ensure it follows the centralized biological rules (`management/rules/biological_constraints.py`).
3.  **Autonomous Execution**: A new **Autonomous Agent** (`quark_state_system/autonomous_agent.py`) is responsible for formulating and executing plans to achieve the next roadmap goal.
4.  **Prompt Guardian**: Every prompt is intercepted and validated by a **Prompt Guardian** (`quark_state_system/prompt_guardian.py`) to ensure alignment and safety.

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started: Interacting with the Active System**

The main entry point for all operations remains `QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py`.

### 1. Check the Current Goal
To understand the system's current priority, simply ask:
> "what is quarks next steps according to the state system?"

### 2. Automating the System
You have two primary ways to drive the system forward:

**A) Step-by-Step Automation (Recommended):**
Use a generic prompt to authorize the agent to execute the *next single task*.
> "proceed"
> "continue"
> "evolve"

The agent will execute one goal and then wait for your next command.

**B) Continuous Full Automation:**
To run the agent continuously until all roadmap goals are complete, use the following command:
```bash
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py run-continuous
```

### 3. All Available Commands
```bash
# Get an explanation of the new active driver mode
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py activate

# Run the full automation loop
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py run-continuous

# Execute a single roadmap goal
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py execute

# Check the system's current status
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py status

# Get intelligent recommendations (based on old system)
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py recommendations

# Manually sync the state files
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py sync

# See all commands
python3 QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py help
```
