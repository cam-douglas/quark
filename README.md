# 🚀 QUARK: Technical Whitepaper

## Overview

Quark is a modular brain-simulation and machine-learning platform spanning molecular genetics → tissue morphogenesis → micro-circuits → cognition. It emphasizes biological fidelity, rigorous testing, and reproducible workflows governed by the Quark State System.

## Current State (via Quark State System)

Current Development Stage: (not found)
Overall Progress: (unknown)
Next Major Milestone: (unknown)


### Operate the State System

```bash
python QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py status
python QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py recommendations
python QUARK_STATE_SYSTEM.py sync
```

## Benchmarks & Capabilities

- tests/cognitive_benchmarks/: working memory, decision-making, reversal learning
- tests/testing_frameworks/: automated validation, live streaming, system health
- tests/simulations/: embodiment and physics hooks
- CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml (runs smoke + benchmark stubs)


## Architecture

- brain/: multi-scale brain architecture (embodiment, learning, neural_core)
- brain/modules/: integration modules (alphagenome, mathematical, etc.)
- brain/simulator/: runtime simulators and entrypoints
- data/: models, datasets, and simulation frameworks (heavy artifacts ignored)
- state/quark_state_system/: autonomous agent, task loader, state orchestration
- docs/: specifications, roadmaps, historical and integration guides
- tests/: benchmarks, visualizations, and CI-friendly checks


## Development & Reproducibility

- Python 3.11, pinned deps in requirements.txt
- CI: GitHub Actions in .github/workflows/ (tests and artifacts)
- Heavy artifacts are ignored via .gitignore (models, large outputs)
- Deterministic runs preferred; seeds where applicable
