# üß† Pillar 3 Completion Summary: Working Memory & Control

## ‚úÖ **PILLAR 3 STATUS: COMPLETED**

**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Implementation**: Working Memory & Thalamic Relay Control System  
**Compliance**: ‚úÖ Fully aligned with all roadmap requirements  

---

## üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW**

Pillar 3 successfully implements the **Working Memory & Control** layer of the brain simulation, focusing on short-term information storage and context-sensitive routing. This provides the foundation for higher-level cognitive functions like reasoning, planning, and executive control.

### **Core Components Implemented**

1. **Working Memory Buffer** (`memory_buffer.py`)
   - Short-term storage with configurable capacity (e.g., 7¬±2 items).
   - Temporal decay of memory items to simulate forgetting.
   - Refresh mechanism to maintain important information.
   - Retrieval of active items based on an activation threshold.

2. **Thalamic Relay System** (`thalamic_relay.py`)
   - Context-sensitive information routing from multiple sources.
   - Attentional gating with normalized weights.
   - Dynamic updating of attention to focus on relevant information.
   - Simulation of the Thalamus's role as a central information hub.

3. **Comprehensive Validation** (`tests/test_pillar3_memory_control.py`)
   - 6 test scenarios covering all aspects of the implementation.
   - Validation of memory capacity, decay, and refresh.
   - Verification of attention-based information routing.
   - Robustness and correctness of all components.
