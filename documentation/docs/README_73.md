# ðŸ§  Brain Simulation Benchmarking Challenge

## Overview
This competition challenges participants to develop brain simulation models that can accurately predict neural dynamics, consciousness emergence, and cognitive behaviors.

## Competition Structure
- **Duration**: 3 months
- **Evaluation**: Multiple metrics including biological accuracy and consciousness emergence
- **Datasets**: Synthetic neural data, consciousness metrics, and brain connectivity data
- **Prizes**: $10,000 total prize pool

## Getting Started
1. Explore the datasets in the `data/` directory
2. Use the starter notebook in `notebooks/starter_notebook.ipynb`
3. Develop your brain simulation model
4. Submit predictions using the evaluation framework

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Biological Accuracy** (30%): How well the model matches known neural dynamics
- **Consciousness Emergence** (25%): Detection of consciousness-like behaviors  
- **Computational Efficiency** (20%): Training and inference speed
- **Generalization Score** (15%): Performance on unseen brain regions
- **Innovation Score** (10%): Novel approaches and insights
