## âœ… **Milestone 1.1: Core Infrastructure & Data Strategy**

**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ NOT STARTED
**Owner**: Data & Pipelines Engineer, Systems Architect

### **Tasks:**

1.  **Define and Implement Data Schemas:**
    -   **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ NOT STARTED
    -   **Description**: Create Python classes (using Pydantic) to define the structure of neural activity (spike trains, LFPs), connectivity (connectomes), and molecular data.
    -   **Deliverable**: A new file `data_knowledge/schemas/neural_data_schemas.py`.
    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: Schemas are well-documented, typed, and include validation for biologically plausible ranges.

2.  **Set Up Experiment Tracking:**
    -   **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ NOT STARTED
    -   **Description**: Configure MLflow or Weights & Biases to log experiment parameters, metrics (both ML and neuroscience-based), and artifacts.
    -   **Deliverable**: Configuration files in `management/configurations/project/tracking.yaml` and a `tools_utilities/automation/experiment_logger.py` utility.
    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: A test script can successfully log a sample experiment with parameters and metrics.

3.  **Establish Baseline Simulation Environment:**
    -   **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ NOT STARTED
    -   **Description**: Set up the core simulation framework (e.g., Brian2). This includes creating a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with pinned versions and a basic simulation loop structure.
    -   **Deliverable**: A `brain_simulation/` directory with a `main.py` entry point and `environment.yaml` or similar.
    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: A simple simulation of a single neuron can be run successfully from the command line.
