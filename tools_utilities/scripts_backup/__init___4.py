ðŸŒ± Development Stages Package - F â†’ N0 â†’ N1 Progression

This package contains developmental stage implementations:

Stages:
- fetal_stage/: F stage - Basic scaffold (3 WM slots, basic BG gating)
- neonate_stage/: N0 stage - Sleep cycles, salience switching (MoE k=2)
- early_postnatal/: N1 stage - Expanded capacity (4 WM slots, cerebellar modulation)

Each stage builds upon the previous with increased complexity and capabilities.
