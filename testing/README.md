# ðŸ§ª TESTING

## Purpose
This directory contains components related to testing and validation frameworks.

## Structure
- `testing_frameworks/` - Comprehensive testing and validation frameworks
  - `core/` - Core experiment framework and protocols
  - `quark_experimentation_protocols.md` - **HIGH PRIORITY** experimentation protocols
  - `main_rules_integration.md` - Main rules integration status
- `results_outputs/` - Test results and system outputs
  - `experiments/` - Experiment results and performance data

## Synergy Type
Validation - Learning validation and error correction

## Description
The Testing layer provides comprehensive validation and testing capabilities for the entire brain-ML synergy system, including:
- **HIGH PRIORITY**: QUARK Experimentation Protocols (SLM + LLM Hybrid Edition)
- **MANDATORY**: Core experiment framework for all testing activities
- Comprehensive system testing frameworks
- Focused and targeted testing approaches
- Core functionality validation
- Experimental result tracking
- Model output validation
- Training result analysis
- Performance benchmarking
- **NEW**: Hybrid SLM+LLM evaluation and neuroalignment testing

## ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY PROTOCOLS
**ALL EXPERIMENTATION AND TESTING MUST FOLLOW THE ESTABLISHED QUARK PROTOCOLS**

This layer ensures that all biological and computational components work correctly and that the synergy between domains is validated and optimized according to the **SUPREME AUTHORITY** testing protocols.

### ðŸ“Š Implementation Status
