## 🚀 MIGRATION EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Create backup of current structure
2. Create new directory hierarchy
3. Generate README files for each level

### Phase 2: Core Migration
1. Migrate brain architecture components
2. Migrate ML architecture components
3. Migrate integration components

### Phase 3: Data Migration
1. Migrate data and knowledge components
2. Migrate development and infrastructure
3. Migrate management components

### Phase 4: Testing Migration
1. Migrate testing frameworks
2. Migrate results and outputs
3. Migrate documentation

### Phase 5: Validation
1. Test all import paths
2. Validate file integrity
3. Test cross-module communication

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Backup First**: Always create a complete backup before migration
2. **Import Updates**: Update all Python import statements after migration
3. **Path References**: Update any hardcoded file paths
4. **Testing**: Test thoroughly after each migration phase
5. **Rollback Plan**: Keep backup accessible for rollback if needed

---

*This migration map ensures that every file in the Quark repository finds its proper place in the new brain-ML synergy architecture, creating a unified cognitive system that leverages both biological and computational approaches.*
