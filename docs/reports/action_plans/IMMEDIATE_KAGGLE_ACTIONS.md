## ðŸš¨ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### If GPU Not Available:
1. Check if you're using a free account
2. Try different GPU types (T4, P100, V100)
3. Wait for GPU availability (usually within minutes)

### If Upload Fails:
1. Check file size (should be <100MB for notebooks)
2. Ensure proper JSON formatting
3. Try uploading in smaller chunks

### If Training Fails:
1. Check Kaggle notebook logs
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Reduce batch size if memory issues
