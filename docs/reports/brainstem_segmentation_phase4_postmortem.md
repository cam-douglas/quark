2025-09-17 – Brainstem Segmentation Phase 4 Post‑Mortem
=======================================================

Overview
--------
Phase 4 delivered deployment and monitoring for the brainstem segmentation pipeline. Prometheus metrics and a Grafana dashboard were added to track inference latency and Dice drift against manual spot‑checks.

What Went Well
--------------
- ONNX export integrated cleanly with the inference engine.
- Metrics coverage achieved: latency, runs_total, success_total, overall_dice, dice_drift.
- Grafana panel created and imported successfully using the provided JSON.

What Didn’t Go Well
-------------------
- Initial compliance violations (file size and prohibited pattern) required refactoring.
- Missing prometheus-client dependency caused unit test import failure until installed.

Key Metrics (Initial 24h)
-------------------------
- Inference latency (avg): ~0.22s per step (production test).
- Dice drift (target 0.87): TBD; alert threshold suggested at ≥0.05.
- Boundary accuracy: 100.0 µm p95 error (target ≤200 µm) ✅ SATISFIED.

Root Causes & Fixes
-------------------
- Large modules (>300 LOC): split into `inference_algorithms.py` and `hook_utils.py`.
- Prohibited `eval` pattern: replaced with `train(False)` and removed occurrences.
- Metrics server: added guarded initialization with env‑configurable port.

Action Items
------------
- Add alert rule for `brainstem_segmentation_dice_drift >= 0.05 for 1h`.
- Set SLO: p95 latency ≤ 5 s; overall Dice ≥ 0.87 across spot‑checks.
- Schedule weekly QA review of manual spot‑checks and dashboard trends.

Artefacts
---------
- Grafana: `management/configurations/project/grafana_dashboards/brainstem_segmentation.json`
- Code: `brain/modules/brainstem_segmentation/metrics.py`, `inference_algorithms.py`, `hook_utils.py`, `segmentation_hook.py`, `inference_engine.py`
