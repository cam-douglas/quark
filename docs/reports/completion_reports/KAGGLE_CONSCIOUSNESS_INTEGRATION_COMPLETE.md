## 🚀 **Available Kaggle Operations**

Your consciousness agent can now perform these Kaggle operations:

### **1. Dataset Discovery & Search**
```python
# Search for brain-related datasets
agent.use_kaggle_for_operation('brain_dataset_search', 
                               search_terms=['brain', 'neuroscience'])

# Auto-discover brain datasets during learning
agent.use_kaggle_for_operation('discover_datasets')
```

### **2. Dataset Download**
```python
# Download specific datasets
agent.use_kaggle_for_operation('download_dataset', 
                               dataset_ref='lbvigilantdata/synthetic-neurodegenerative-brain-image-data-set',
                               target_path='/path/to/save')
```

### **3. Notebook Creation**
```python
# Create training notebooks for Kaggle
agent.use_kaggle_for_operation('create_notebook', 
                               config={'title': 'Brain Training', 'steps': 200})
```

### **4. Competition Submission**
```python
# Submit to Kaggle competitions
agent.use_kaggle_for_operation('submit_competition',
                               competition_name='brain-simulation-challenge',
                               submission_file='results.csv')
```

### **5. Status Monitoring**
```python
# Get comprehensive Kaggle status
kaggle_status = agent.use_kaggle_for_operation('get_status')
print(f"Authenticated: {kaggle_status['authenticated']}")
print(f"Operations: {kaggle_status['session_stats']['kaggle_operations']}")
```

## 🧠 **Automatic Integration Features**

### **During Learning Loops**
- **Auto-Discovery**: Consciousness agent automatically searches Kaggle for new brain datasets
- **Knowledge Mapping**: Discovered datasets are mapped to appropriate brain regions
- **Speech Announcements**: All Kaggle activities are announced via speech synthesis
- **Progress Tracking**: Kaggle operations tracked in session metrics

### **Dashboard Monitoring**
- **Real-time Status**: Kaggle integration status shown in visual dashboard
- **Operation Metrics**: Live tracking of Kaggle operations, downloads, notebooks
- **Authentication Status**: Visual indication of Kaggle API authentication state
