## 🔄 NEXT STEPS - PHASE 2: FILE MIGRATION

### **Current Status**: Architecture Created, Files Not Yet Migrated

The new directory structure is now in place, but the existing files still need to be moved from their current locations to the new structure according to the migration map.

### **What Needs to Be Done**:

#### 1. **Execute File Migration** (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Move `brain_modules/` → `🧠_BRAIN_ARCHITECTURE/01_NEURAL_CORE/`
- [ ] Move `expert_domains/` → `🤖_ML_ARCHITECTURE/01_EXPERT_DOMAINS/`
- [ ] Move `training/` → `🤖_ML_ARCHITECTURE/02_TRAINING_SYSTEMS/`
- [ ] Move `knowledge_systems/` → `🤖_ML_ARCHITECTURE/03_KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEMS/`
- [ ] Move `architecture/` → `🔄_INTEGRATION/01_ARCHITECTURE/`
- [ ] Move `applications/` → `🔄_INTEGRATION/02_APPLICATIONS/`
- [ ] Move `data/` → `📊_DATA_KNOWLEDGE/01_DATA_REPOSITORY/`
- [ ] Move `models/` → `📊_DATA_KNOWLEDGE/02_MODELS_ARTIFACTS/`
- [ ] Move `research_lab/` → `📊_DATA_KNOWLEDGE/03_RESEARCH/`
- [ ] Move `development_stages/` → `🛠️_DEVELOPMENT/01_DEVELOPMENT_STAGES/`
- [ ] Move `tools_utilities/` → `🛠️_DEVELOPMENT/02_TOOLS_UTILITIES/`
- [ ] Move `deployment/` → `🛠️_DEVELOPMENT/03_DEPLOYMENT/`
- [ ] Move `configs/` → `📋_MANAGEMENT/01_CONFIGURATIONS/`
- [ ] Move `project_management/` → `📋_MANAGEMENT/02_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/`
- [ ] Move `tests/` → `🧪_TESTING/01_TESTING_FRAMEWORKS/`
- [ ] Move `results/` → `🧪_TESTING/02_RESULTS_OUTPUTS/`
- [ ] Move `docs/` → `📚_DOCUMENTATION/01_DOCS/`
- [ ] Move `summaries/` → `📚_DOCUMENTATION/02_SUMMARIES/`
- [ ] Move `reports/` → `📚_DOCUMENTATION/03_REPORTS/`

#### 2. **Update Import Paths** (Week 4)
- [ ] Update all Python import statements
- [ ] Fix any hardcoded file paths
- [ ] Update configuration files

#### 3. **Validate Migration** (Week 4-5)
- [ ] Test all import paths
- [ ] Validate file integrity
- [ ] Test cross-module communication

## 🎯 CURRENT ARCHITECTURE STATUS

### **What's Working** ✅
- **New Directory Structure**: Complete and organized
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and clear
- **README Files**: Self-documenting structure
- **Migration Plan**: Detailed and ready for execution

### **What's Not Yet Working** ⚠️
- **File Locations**: All files still in original locations
- **Import Paths**: Python imports still reference old structure
- **Cross-Module Communication**: Not yet tested with new structure
- **Functionality**: System not yet functional with new architecture

---

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

### **Option 1: Execute Migration Now**
```bash
# This would move all files to new structure
# Requires careful execution and testing
```

### **Option 2: Test Migration with Sample Files**
```bash
# Move a few key directories first
# Test functionality before full migration
```

### **Option 3: Create Migration Scripts**
```bash
# Build automated migration tools
# Ensure safe and reversible migration
```
