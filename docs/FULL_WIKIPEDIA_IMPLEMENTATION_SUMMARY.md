## 🔧 Training Configuration

### Default Settings (Optimized for Full Training)
```python
training_config = {
    "num_train_epochs": 1,                    # Start with 1 epoch
    "per_device_train_batch_size": 2,         # Conservative batch size
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 8,         # Effective batch size = 16
    "learning_rate": 3e-5,                    # Stable learning rate
    "warmup_steps": 1000,                     # Gradual warmup
    "save_steps": 10000,                      # Regular checkpoints
    "fp16": True,                             # Mixed precision
}
```
