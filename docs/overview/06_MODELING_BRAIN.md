Modeling the Human Brain: Biological Processes and Machine Learning Approaches

Introduction:
Simulating the human brain is often called the holy grail of neuroscience – a grand challenge whose solution could transform our understanding of cognition and disease
thevirtualbrain.org
. Achieving this requires bridging multiple scales of biology: from the genetic blueprint in DNA, to the protein molecules that build cells, up to networks of neurons that produce behavior. Modern efforts have yet to realize a full brain simulation, largely due to the overwhelming complexity and data requirements

. However, recent advances in machine learning (ML) are providing powerful new tools to model each level of this hierarchy. Cutting-edge techniques – especially deep neural networks and foundation models – are now being applied in genomics, protein science, and neural network simulation. Below, we explore how these ML innovations are helping simulate aspects of human brain development and function, from DNA and proteins to entire brain circuits.

DNA: The Genetic Blueprint and AI Modeling

The human brain’s development is orchestrated by tens of thousands of genes encoded in DNA. These genes control when and where neurons form, how they differentiate, and how they connect, essentially serving as a genetic blueprint for building the brain. Modeling such genomic programs is extremely complex, as gene regulation involves myriad interactions (enhancers, transcription factors, noncoding DNA, etc.). Here, machine learning is making inroads by learning patterns from massive genomic datasets that are beyond manual analysis.

Deep Learning in Genomics: New foundation models for DNA and gene expression have emerged that can read the genome and predict biological outcomes. For example, transformer-based networks (inspired by those used in natural language processing) can analyze very long DNA sequences to predict gene activity. DeepMind’s Enformer is a prime example: it processes 200,000 base pairs of DNA sequence at a time – on the order of entire gene regulatory regions – and learns to predict how distant DNA elements like enhancers influence gene expression

. By using self-attention across such long stretches of DNA, Enformer dramatically improved accuracy in predicting gene expression from sequence alone
deepmind.google
. This means AI can now help identify which genomic instructions turn specific genes on/off in the developing brain, even when those instructions are located far from the gene in the DNA strand. More generally, “newly developed foundation models present exciting opportunities for uncovering gene expression programs and predicting genetic perturbations,” including in the context of brain development
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In practice, this means large neural networks can be trained on encyclopedic genomic data to infer how combinations of DNA elements drive the complex spatial-temporal patterns of gene activity that build a brain.

Gene Networks and Variants: Another way ML aids genomic understanding is by deciphering gene regulatory networks – the webs of interactions by which some genes control others. Researchers are using deep learning to integrate multi-omics data (DNA, RNA, chromatin state, etc.) and infer these networks, even at single-cell resolution

. By learning from large atlases of cells, ML models can predict how a change in one gene might ripple through a network to affect others. This is critical for simulating developmental processes, where turning on one “master gene” can trigger cascades that specify a neuron’s type or guide the formation of a brain region.

ML is also being applied to predict effects of genetic mutations relevant to brain function and disease. A recent breakthrough in this realm is AlphaMissense (2023), an AI model that evaluated every possible single-letter mutation in human DNA that leads to an amino acid change (a missense mutation in a protein). Out of ~71 million such variants, AlphaMissense was able to classify 89% of them as either likely benign or likely disease-causing
deepmind.google
deepmind.google
. (For context, before this AI work, over 99% of those variants were “unknown” to science
deepmind.google
.) AlphaMissense achieved this by leveraging a protein-trained neural network (a variant of AlphaFold) and fine-tuning it on big genetic databases
deepmind.google
deepmind.google
. The result is essentially a computational catalogue of which DNA mutations might disrupt protein function and thus brain development or health. Such models can pinpoint genetic changes that lead to neurological disorders, helping researchers focus on the most impactful variants. In summary, AI models at the DNA level are decoding the genome’s language – identifying regulatory instructions and mutation effects – thereby laying the groundwork for simulating how genes build a brain.

Proteins: Molecular Machines and AI Prediction

If genes are the blueprint, proteins are the construction workers and components that actually assemble and operate the brain. Neurons and their synapses are built and run by thousands of proteins: structural proteins shape neurons’ branching architecture, ion-channel and receptor proteins govern electrical signaling at synapses, enzymes synthesize neurotransmitters, and so on. To simulate brain biology, we must understand these proteins’ structures and interactions. This has historically been a huge challenge – e.g. determining a single protein’s 3D structure could take years of lab work. Machine learning has revolutionized this area with advanced prediction algorithms, enabling us to virtually model many proteins relevant to the brain.

Protein Structure Prediction: The seminal breakthrough came from DeepMind’s AlphaFold2 in 2020. AlphaFold2 is a deep learning system (utilizing transformer architectures and evolutionary information) that can predict the 3D structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence with atomic-level accuracy
laskerfoundation.org
. In the critical CASP competition, AlphaFold2’s predictions were as precise as experimental methods for many targets
laskerfoundation.org
. The impact was dramatic: by July 2021, the AlphaFold team released predicted structures for almost every protein in the human body (over 20,000 of them)
laskerfoundation.org
. This feat essentially solved the structures of most human brain proteins – many of which (like membrane receptors in the brain) were previously elusive. AlphaFold’s success didn’t stop there: it was subsequently expanded into an open database of protein structures. As of 2022, over 200 million protein structures have been predicted by AlphaFold – nearly all catalogued proteins known to science across numerous organisms
deepmind.google
. This means AI has given biologists a virtual library of molecular shapes to work with. Neuroscientists can now inspect models of synaptic proteins, ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, etc., gaining insight into how they function and how mutations might affect them. In practical terms, years of experimental effort have been saved – “what took us months or years to do, AlphaFold was able to do in a weekend,” as one researcher noted
deepmind.google
.

Beyond individual proteins, ML models are tackling more complex protein interactions. New versions like AlphaFold-Multimer (sometimes referred to as AlphaFold3) use diffusion-based networks to predict how multiple proteins assemble into complexes
nature.com
. In the brain, many proteins work in teams (for example, receptor complexes or enzyme cascades), so understanding their joint structure is key to simulating molecular physiology. Other AI techniques, such as protein language models (which treat amino acid sequences like sentences), are able to generate de novo protein designs with desired functions. Researchers have begun designing novel proteins like enzymes and antibodies using generative models, a strategy that could conceivably be used to design molecules to influence brain processes or even repair neural damage. While this is still early-stage, it shows the potential for ML to not just predict biology but create new biological tools.

In summary, AI-driven protein modeling gives us a detailed parts list for the brain. We can now simulate how a neurotransmitter receptor folds and perhaps how it will respond to a drug, or predict how a mutation in a neural protein could alter its shape and cause disease. These advances in protein modeling are an essential link in the chain from genes to brain function, enabling integrative simulations (for instance, modeling how altered protein structure due to a genetic mutation cascades into altered neuron firing or synapse strength). With ML, the once-impenetrable molecular layer of the brain is becoming much more transparent.

Neural Networks: Simulating Brain Circuits with AI

At the highest level, the brain is a network of neurons – about 86 billion in the human cortex – exchanging electrical pulses and adapting their connections. Simulating neural activity and brain-wide behavior is extraordinarily demanding: it requires solving complex mathematical models (e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley equations for each neuron’s membrane) and handling massive networks. Traditional computational neuroscience has made progress on small circuits, but a full human brain simulation remains out of reach for now
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Still, modern machine learning is accelerating progress by providing new algorithms and computational tools to model neural circuits. Two complementary approaches have emerged: biophysically-detailed simulations accelerated by AI hardware, and data-driven neural models inspired by AI architectures.

Biophysical Neural Simulation and Acceleration: One approach is to simulate neurons at a detailed physical level (modeling ion channel currents, synaptic conductances, etc.) and use advanced computing to scale this up. The European Human Brain Project and projects like Blue Brain have built detailed models of cortical microcircuits with thousands of neurons, but scaling to billions of neurons (a whole brain) is a monumental task. As one analysis noted, “a simulation of the human whole brain has not yet been achieved as of 2024 due to insufficient computational performance and brain measurement data”
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In other words, even with today’s supercomputers, we don’t have enough compute power or biological data to simulate every neuron and synapse in a human brain in full detail. Estimates based on current trends suggest that a mouse brain might be simulatable by ~2034, but a human brain not until after 2044, assuming exponential advances in computing power
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
.

Given these limits, researchers are turning to machine learning hardware and software to speed up neural simulations. A notable development is the use of deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow/PyTorch) and AI chips to run neuroscience models more efficiently. For example, one 2024 study introduced a workflow to simulate spiking neural networks using Google’s TensorFlow, executed on specialized AI hardware including GPUs, TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and IPUs
repository.tudelft.nl
repository.tudelft.nl
. The results were striking: at large scales (millions of neurons), these AI accelerators achieved between 29× and 1,208× speedup over standard CPU simulations
repository.tudelft.nl
. In fact, the Google TPU set a new record by handling the largest real-time simulation of an entire brain nucleus (the inferior olivary nucleus) to date
repository.tudelft.nl
. This demonstrates that the same chips used to train deep neural networks can be repurposed to simulate biological neural networks orders-of-magnitude faster. Additionally, neuromorphic computing platforms are being explored. These are physical hardware implementations of neurons and synapses (examples include SpiNNaker and Intel’s Loihi). They operate in parallel like the brain and can simulate networks with high energy efficiency. New simulator frameworks (e.g. the EDEN platform) allow plugging such custom hardware into neural simulations easily
repository.tudelft.nl
. By integrating neuromorphic chips as backends, researchers have run large spiking models (like networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons) with impressive speed and scalability
repository.tudelft.nl
repository.tudelft.nl
. The upshot is that AI is not only an inspiration for models, but also a toolset – leveraging advances in ML software and silicon to push brain simulation further than traditional scientific computing could.

Data-Driven “Digital Twins” of Brain Circuits: Another frontier is using ML models inspired by brain data to create functional simulations of neural systems. Rather than modeling every channel in every neuron, this approach trains AI networks directly on empirical recordings from real brains, so that the AI learns to emulate the brain’s input–output behavior. A milestone example appeared in 2025: researchers created a “digital twin” of the mouse visual cortex using a foundation model approach
neuroscience.stanford.edu
. They recorded neural activity from a mouse’s visual brain area while the mouse watched movies, and then they trained a transformer-based neural network (similar to those behind ChatGPT) on this neural data
neuroscience.stanford.edu
neuroscience.stanford.edu
. Essentially, instead of training on text, they trained on patterns of firing neurons. The resulting model could accurately predict how the real neurons would respond to new, unseen visual scenes
neuroscience.stanford.edu
. Like a large language model generalizing to new sentences, this brain-model was able to generalize to new images and movies outside its training set
neuroscience.stanford.edu
. In effect, the AI had learned the neural code of the mouse’s visual cortex – it captured the fundamental algorithm that that piece of brain uses to process visual information.

The implications of this are profound. The model serves as a digital copy of a brain region’s function, allowing experiments that would be impractical on a live animal. Researchers noted that the digital cortex “doesn’t sleep, doesn’t age, and can be replicated”, meaning many laboratories can experiment on identical copies of it in silico
neuroscience.stanford.edu
. For instance, one could virtually “lesion” certain neurons in the model or test thousands of visual stimuli to see how the network responds, gaining insight into the real cortex’s principles. This foundation model of the brain concept – training large AI models on neuroscience data – is opening a new avenue to simulate brain activity at an algorithmic level
neuroscience.stanford.edu
. It blurs the line between neuroscience and AI, essentially using one to inform the other. As Dan Yamins (a leader in NeuroAI) discussed, these advances raise the question: are we ready to create a digital twin of the human brain?
neuroscience.stanford.edu
neuroscience.stanford.edu
. Such a model would require orders of magnitude more data (human brain recordings across many regions and behaviors) and new architectures that can handle the brain’s complexity. It’s a daunting task, but researchers are sketching out what it might look like
neuroscience.stanford.edu
 – perhaps a network of networks, mirroring visual cortex, auditory cortex, etc., each trained on big neural datasets, then interconnected. While we’re far from achieving a whole-brain foundation model, the mouse visual cortex success is a proof-of-concept that cannot be ignored. It suggests that, given enough data, AI can learn the underlying computations of brain circuits and reproduce them in simulation
neuroscience.stanford.edu
.

Toward Whole-Brain Simulation: In parallel to these AI-driven algorithms, other efforts are using hybrid approaches to simulate the brain at a more coarse level for practical use. One prominent platform is The Virtual Brain (TVB), which aims to simulate whole-brain dynamics by simplifying neurons into larger mathematical units. TVB uses each individual’s brain imaging (e.g. MRI-derived connectomes) and assigns simplified neural population models to each brain region
thevirtualbrain.org
. By tuning the parameters, TVB can generate brain-wide activity signals (EEG, fMRI, etc.) that approximate those observed in that person
thevirtualbrain.org
. This reduction of detail – “reducing complexity millionfold” on the micro level to attain the correct macro-level behavior
thevirtualbrain.org
 – allows a human brain’s activity to be simulated on a normal computer (even a laptop)
thevirtualbrain.org
. Such simulations sacrifice biological realism at the neuron level, but they can be incredibly useful for certain applications. For example, TVB is being used in a clinical trial for planning epilepsy surgery, where a patient’s brain model is run to predict how their seizures spread and to test virtually how removing a certain brain region might stop the seizures
thevirtualbrain.org
. This personalized “virtual brain twin” for the patient can help surgeons strategize with much more information than otherwise possible. The success of TVB demonstrates that multi-scale modeling – combining real anatomical data with simplified neural math and even ML optimization – can yield actionable simulations today
thevirtualbrain.org
.

Looking forward, the ultimate goal is to integrate these approaches into a coherent simulation of a human brain. This may involve multi-scale AI models: using detailed AI predictions where they matter (e.g. modeling a neuron’s ion channel using an ML-based surrogate model if a gene mutation demands it), but using higher-level AI models for large circuits (like the digital twin of cortex approach) where fine detail is less tractable. We might envision, for instance, a whole-brain simulation where each cortical area is represented by a learned model that emulates that area’s input-output function (trained on real brain data), and these area models communicate according to a connectome – effectively an AI brain emulator. Meanwhile, critical molecular details (like synaptic plasticity rules, or disease-related protein dynamics) could be plugged in from separate ML models that learned those from biophysical data.

In conclusion, machine learning is accelerating brain simulation at every level of biology. At the genetic level, AI decodes the DNA instructions that shape neural development. At the protein level, AI reveals structures and interactions of the brain’s molecular machinery. At the neural circuit level, AI both speeds up detailed simulations and offers new data-driven models that mimic brain functions. While a full human brain simulation remains decades away by most estimates

 the synergy of biological knowledge and cutting-edge ML is bringing us closer. Each advance – be it predicting a protein fold or creating a digital cortical column – is like adding another piece to an ever more complete blueprint of the brain. With ongoing research, the once “science-fiction” idea of truly simulating a human brain is gradually shifting into the realm of technical possibility, powered by the convergence of neuroscience and AI
