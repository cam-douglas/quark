The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, divided into left and right hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum
kenhub.com
. Each hemisphere’s surface is highly folded into gyri (ridges) and sulci (grooves), which increase cortical surface area
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The cerebrum’s outer 2–4 mm is the cerebral cortex (gray matter consisting of neuron cell bodies and dendrites) and beneath lies subcortical white matter (myelinated axon tracts)
kenhub.com
. Each hemisphere is organized into lobes with distinct functions
kenhub.com
: the frontal lobes (anterior) handle executive functions, decision making, and voluntary motor control (housing the primary motor cortex); the parietal lobes (dorsal-posterior) process somatosensory information and spatial orientation (housing the primary somatosensory cortex); the occipital lobes (posterior) are devoted to vision (containing the primary visual cortex); and the temporal lobes (lateral) handle auditory processing, language comprehension, and memory (they include the primary auditory cortex and medial temporal structures like the hippocampus). An additional insular lobe is hidden deep within the lateral sulcus, and a limbic lobe (including cingulate and parahippocampal regions) is sometimes defined for emotion and memory functions

o8t.com
.

Beneath the cortex lie the subcortical structures, which are clusters of gray matter (nuclei) embedded in white matter
kenhub.com
. Key subcortical regions include the diencephalon and basal ganglia. The diencephalon consists of the thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus, and subthalamus
kenhub.com
kenhub.com
. The thalamus is the brain’s central relay station – nearly all sensory signals (vision, hearing, touch, etc.) and motor signals pass through thalamic nuclei on their way to or from the cortex
kenhub.com
. The hypothalamus (below the thalamus) regulates homeostasis and drives endocrine, autonomic, and motivational functions (e.g. hunger, temperature, stress responses) via hormone release and neural circuits
kenhub.com
. The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected subcortical nuclei – including the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra – crucial for initiating and modulating movements
kenhub.com
. They form feedback loops with the cortex and thalamus to fine-tune motor commands (the extrapyramidal motor system), and disturbances in these circuits underlie movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease
kenhub.com
. The limbic system, spanning cortical and subcortical regions, includes structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala. This system integrates emotion, motivation, and memory processes
o8t.com
 – for example, the hippocampus (in the medial temporal lobe) is essential for forming new memories, and the amygdala orchestrates emotional responses.

The brainstem sits at the base of the brain, connecting the cerebrum to the spinal cord. It is composed of three continuous structures: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata
aans.org
. The brainstem contains numerous nuclei and fiber tracts that act as vital relay stations, passing messages between the brain and body
aans.org
. It also houses the nuclei for most of the cranial nerves, which control functions like eye movements, facial sensation, hearing, taste, and swallowing
aans.org
aans.org
. Critically, the brainstem governs many primitive life-sustaining functions: for example, the medulla oblongata regulates respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure, and damage to it can cause loss of these essential functions
aans.org
. The midbrain contains centers for reflexive eye movements and auditory/visual processing, while the pons helps coordinate facial movements, hearing, and balance
aans.org
. Running through the brainstem is the reticular activating system, which broadly regulates arousal and consciousness
aans.org
. In short, the brainstem is an evolutionarily ancient control center necessary for basic survival functions and for routing information between the higher brain and spinal cord.

The cerebellum (“little brain”) lies behind and below the cerebrum, underneath the occipital lobes
aans.org
. It is connected to the brainstem by cerebellar peduncles (thick fiber tracts)
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The cerebellum’s primary role is to fine-tune motor activity, coordination, and balance
aans.org
. It adjusts the force, timing, and precision of movements by integrating sensory feedback with motor signals – for example, ensuring smooth execution of skilled movements and maintaining posture
aans.org
. Damage to the cerebellum causes problems with equilibrium, gait, and coordinated tasks. Although traditionally viewed as purely motor, the cerebellum is also involved in cognitive functions like attention and language to some degree. Structurally, the cerebellum has a cortex with a distinct three-layer microcircuit (granular, Purkinje, and molecular layers) and deep nuclei that output to other brain regions

Large-Scale Functional Networks of the Brain

In addition to anatomical divisions, the brain can be described in terms of large-scale functional networks – distributed groups of regions that consistently co-activate and communicate during certain classes of tasks or mental states. Modern neuroscience has identified several key intrinsic networks that span across lobes (identified via techniques like fMRI connectivity mapping). These networks coordinate specific domains of cognition and behavior:

Default Mode Network (DMN) – This network (sometimes called the “task-negative” network) is most active during internally focused, self-referential thought and when a person is at wakeful rest (daydreaming, envisioning the future, recalling memories, etc.). It involves midline cortical regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, as well as lateral parietal areas. The DMN is essentially the brain’s “internal mind,” responsible for introspective functions like autobiographical memory, imagining hypothetical scenarios, and simulating social interactions
o8t.com
. When we turn our attention inward (for example, contemplating oneself or others’ mental states), the DMN becomes active, and it typically deactivates during demanding external tasks. Disruptions in the DMN have been linked to conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and depression, highlighting its role in integrating memory and emotion with one’s sense of self.

Salience Network (SN) – The salience network serves as a dynamic switch between the internal mode and external task-focused processing
o8t.com
. Centered on the anterior cingulate cortex and fronto-insular cortex, the SN rapidly evaluates incoming stimuli (whether external sensory events or internal signals) to determine what is most salient – i.e. behaviorally relevant or novel – and thus deserving of attention. By toggling between the DMN and executive/attention networks, the salience network helps allocate the brain’s resources to the most pertinent stimuli or thoughts
o8t.com
. For example, the SN will help shift you from mind-wandering (DMN activity) to focused attention if something important or unexpected happens in the environment. In addition to attentional switching, the SN integrates emotional and interoceptive information (bodily states) and is involved in pain processing. Overactivity or underactivity of the salience network has been implicated in psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia or anxiety) where the filtering of salient vs. irrelevant stimuli is disrupted
o8t.com
.

Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) – The dorsal attention network is a bilateral network (comprising regions like the intraparietal sulcus and frontal eye fields in each hemisphere) that handles top-down, voluntary attention to external stimuli
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. It is engaged when we consciously direct our focus according to our goals – for instance, searching for a friend in a crowd or focusing on a specific task. The DAN is sometimes called the “task-positive” network because it typically increases in activity during goal-directed behavior
en.wikipedia.org
. Functionally, this network allows one to hold and manipulate attentional focus, enhancing sensory processing of selected targets and filtering out distractions. It is considered “dorsal” because it involves upper bank cortical areas in frontal and parietal lobes. The DAN works in concert with its counterpart, the ventral attention system, and with executive control regions to facilitate adaptive behavior.

Ventral Attention Network (VAN) – Also known as the “orienting network,” the ventral attention network is lateralized more to the right hemisphere and complements the DAN by mediating bottom-up attention
o8t.com
. It activates when unexpected, novel, or salient stimuli (especially those outside the current focus of attention) capture our attention reflexively. Key nodes include the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventral frontal cortex (VFC)
en.m.wikipedia.org
en.m.wikipedia.org
. For example, if you are focusing on reading (dorsal network active) and someone calls your name or a loud noise occurs, the VAN triggers a reorientation to that stimulus. In effect, the ventral network acts as a circuit breaker to redirect attention to important changes in the environment. The dorsal and ventral attention networks work together to enable dynamic control of attention, with the salience network often regulating the switch between focused (DAN-mediated) and stimulus-driven (VAN-mediated) attention
en.wikipedia.org
o8t.com
.

Sensorimotor Network – This encompasses the primary sensory and motor regions and associated areas that integrate sensory inputs with motor outputs. Often the sensorimotor network is separated into sub-networks for each modality (visual, auditory, somatosensory, etc.), but collectively it refers to the circuits that handle perception and action. For instance, the somatomotor network includes the primary motor cortex (in the precentral gyrus) and primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus), along with premotor and supplementary motor areas, all of which cooperate for planning and executing movements and processing touch/proprioceptive feedback. Similarly, primary auditory cortex (temporal lobe) and primary visual cortex (occipital lobe) plus their adjacent higher-order areas form auditory and visual networks. These sensorimotor regions are sometimes grouped as a single large network because they often co-activate during basic interactive tasks (seeing, hearing, moving). In general, the sensorimotor network “transduces” between the external world and internal brain representations – it controls sensation and motor functions (“the transducer” of the mind)
o8t.com
. Activity in this network is prominent during tasks like walking (which involves continuous sensory feedback and motor adjustment) or speaking (auditory feedback and motor control of speech muscles).

These networks are not isolated; they interact and overlap in supporting complex behaviors
o8t.com
. For example, doing mental arithmetic might engage an executive control network (closely related to the dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks), while simultaneously suppressing the default mode network. Most complex cognitive tasks recruit multiple networks in parallel
o8t.com
. An important example of network interaction is the balance between the Default Mode Network and a so-called Central Executive Network (CEN) (a frontoparietal network for active problem-solving and working memory). Typically, when the CEN (the “external mind”) is engaged in demanding tasks, the DMN (the “internal mind”) is relatively suppressed, and vice-versa
o8t.com
o8t.com
. The salience network mediates this balance by rapidly activating the appropriate network based on context
o8t.com
. In healthy function, the brain seamlessly switches between internal mentation and external attention as needed. Dysregulation of these network dynamics – for instance, a failure to deactivate the DMN during tasks, or aberrant salience tagging of irrelevant stimuli – is associated with various neurological and psychiatric conditions

Neocortical Architecture: Layers, Columns, and Microcircuits

A hallmark of the human neocortex (the evolutionarily “new” part of cortex) is its six-layered structure with characteristic cell types and connectivity in each layer
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. The layers are labeled I to VI (from the outermost pia surface inward toward the white matter)
en.wikipedia.org
. Layer I (the molecular layer) lies just under the pia and contains relatively few neurons – it’s mostly dendritic tufts and axons from neurons located in lower layers. Layers II and III (often grouped as superficial layers II/III) contain small to medium pyramidal neurons (excitatory cells) that project to other cortical areas across the same or opposite hemisphere
en.wikipedia.org
. Layer IV is the granular layer, rich in stellate interneurons in sensory cortices – it is the main target for incoming sensory afferents from the thalamus
en.wikipedia.org
. Thus, thalamic relay neurons synapse primarily onto layer IV neurons, which then distribute information to the upper and lower layers for further processing
en.wikipedia.org
. Layer V contains large pyramidal neurons (e.g. Betz cells in motor cortex) whose long axons project to subcortical structures such as the brainstem, spinal cord, and basal ganglia
en.wikipedia.org
. These layer V cells are the principal output neurons driving downstream motor and executive targets. Layer VI, the deepest, also has pyramidal neurons that project mainly back to the thalamus (the corticothalamic feedback pathway) and to other cortical areas, as well as a mix of interneurons
en.wikipedia.org
. Layer VI provides feedback modulation to thalamic nuclei, closing the loop in corticothalamo-cortical circuits and enabling cortex to influence the sensory input it receives
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. (Notably, in primary motor cortex – a “agranular” cortex – layer IV is thin or absent
en.wikipedia.org
, reflecting that motor cortex is primarily an output region).

The neocortex is populated by a vast diversity of neurons, broadly classified into excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) types. Approximately ~80% of cortical neurons are excitatory pyramidal cells and ~20% are inhibitory interneurons
en.wikipedia.org
. Excitatory neurons typically have long apical dendrites reaching toward layer I and send axons to distant targets, whereas inhibitory interneurons (such as basket cells, chandelier cells, and double-bouquet cells) are locally projecting cells that regulate the activity of nearby pyramidal neurons. Despite the diversity of specific cell subtypes (with hundreds of genetic/morphological types identified
en.wikipedia.org
), the cortex exhibits a canonical microcircuit motif: feedforward input flows into layer IV, propagates up to layers II/III (which interconnect locally and send outputs to other cortical areas), and then down to layers V and VI (which send outputs to subcortical targets and feedback to thalamus, respectively)
en.wikipedia.org
. Meanwhile, interneurons in each layer provide lateral inhibition and timing control, creating oscillatory dynamics. This recurrent, layered loop enables both bottom-up sensory processing and top-down contextual modulation within a cortical area.

Figure: Reconstruction of neurons in distinct neocortical layers (mouse visual cortex). Cells in layers II/III (green) project to other cortical areas; layer IV neurons (purple) receive thalamic input; layers V (red) and VI (yellow) project out of cortex (to subcortical targets and back to thalamus). Such layered microcircuits repeat across the cortex
en.wikipedia.org
en.m.wikipedia.org
.

Cortical neurons are also organized vertically into functional columns. A cortical column is a small slab of cortex (on the order of ~0.5 mm in diameter) spanning all layers I–VI, within which neurons tend to respond to the same type of stimulus or modality
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. This concept, first proposed by Mountcastle, suggests that neurons stacked in a minicolumn (~80–100 neurons in a 30 µm width) share a receptive field or processing feature (for example, encoding the same patch of skin or the same orientation of a visual line)
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Many such minicolumns cluster into a macrocolumn (~0.5 mm across) that contains a full set of feature variations (e.g. all orientations 0–180° for a given retinal location)
en.wikipedia.org
. The columnar organization reflects the fact that intracolumnar (vertical) connections are much denser than intercolumnar (horizontal) connections
en.wikipedia.org
 – neurons preferentially connect to those above and below them across layers, forming a repeating radially symmetric circuit motif. These columnar microcircuits are hypothesized to act as repeated “canonical circuits” for cortical computation
en.wikipedia.org
. The cortex can be thought of as a massive parallel array of such microcircuits, each performing a basic operation (like detecting an edge or a frequency) and stacked/hierarchically organized to create complex representations. Evolutionarily, this modular design is efficient – expanding the neocortex during primate evolution may have involved duplicating columns and their internal wiring, allowing the cortex to triple in size while maintaining the same basic circuit blueprint
en.wikipedia.org
.

Importantly, cortical processing is recurrent (not strictly feedforward). Recurrent loops exist within a column (through excitatory-inhibitory feedback that can amplify or tune responses) and between areas (through corticocortical feedback and lateral connections). These recurrent circuits enable phenomena like sustained activity (working memory traces), attractor dynamics, and prediction/error correction cycles (as in predictive coding theories where higher-level cortical areas send predictions back to lower areas)
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. In essence, perception emerges from an ongoing dialogue: feedforward signals carry sensory evidence up the hierarchy, while feedback signals convey prior expectations and context down the hierarchy. This interplay allows the cortex to interpret ambiguous inputs in light of past experience and to fill in missing information. For example, corticothalamic feedback from layer VI can finely adjust the sensitivity of thalamic relays, effectively gating the incoming sensory flow depending on attention or brain state
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Such reciprocal loops and distributed processing are key to the brain’s adaptability and robustness.

Connectivity and Connectomics: Local and Long-Range Wiring

The brain’s impressive capabilities arise from its connectivity – the trillions of synaptic connections linking neurons into circuits and networks. We can consider connectivity on multiple scales. Locally, neurons within a region are highly interconnected into microcircuits (e.g. cortical columns or cerebellar microzones). Long-range, different brain regions are connected by bundles of myelinated axons, the white matter tracts, which serve as information highways between distant processing centers
kenhub.com
kenhub.com
. White matter tracts are essentially nerve fiber bundles analogous to communication cables: for example, the corpus callosum connects corresponding areas of the left and right hemispheres, allowing interhemispheric integration; association tracts like the superior longitudinal fasciculus link frontal and parietal lobes within the same hemisphere, supporting functions like language and attention; and projection tracts like the internal capsule carry signals between the cortex and subcortical structures (e.g. sending motor commands down to the spinal cord, or carrying sensory information up to cortex).

These long-range connections and local circuits together form the connectome – a complete map of neural connections in the brain
o8t.com
. The human connectome can be modeled as a complex graph of nodes (brain regions or neurons) and edges (connections). Studies of the connectome reveal that brain networks have a characteristic small-world architecture, meaning they achieve high local clustering as well as short path lengths between distant nodes
en.wikipedia.org
. In practical terms, this indicates the brain is organized into local clusters or modules (neurons in a region strongly interconnected for specialized processing) that are efficiently linked by a few long-range hub connections, so that any two regions are separated by only a few intermediate steps
en.wikipedia.org
. This small-world topology favors both segregated processing in specialized modules and integrated processing across the whole brain when needed
en.wikipedia.org
. It also makes the network robust: local processing can continue relatively unaffected by damage elsewhere, yet information can rapidly propagate globally when required
en.wikipedia.org
. Empirical studies confirm that both structural and functional brain networks exhibit small-world properties across many species
en.wikipedia.org
.

From a “wiring” standpoint, the cortex follows certain organizing principles. Neighboring regions (e.g. adjacent cortical areas) are often connected by short U-fibers just beneath the gray matter, enabling gradual information flow (like a sensory gradient from primary to secondary to tertiary areas). Long-range fascicles connect functionally related regions that may be far apart – for instance, the connection between the occipital lobe (vision) and frontal lobe (eye movement control) through the dorsal pathway, or between auditory cortex and frontal speech areas via the arcuate fasciculus. Certain cortical areas act as network hubs, with an exceptionally high number of long-range connections, notably parts of the parietal and prefrontal cortex
en.wikipedia.org
. These hubs integrate inputs from multiple modalities and are crucial for higher-order cognition. The connectomics field, aided by diffusion MRI tractography and graph theory, aims to chart these connections in detail and understand how network structure underlies function
o8t.com
o8t.com
. The Human Connectome Project and related efforts have mapped major fiber pathways and found that they account for the vast majority of white matter volume in the brain
nature.com
nature.com
. Visualizing these in 3D shows an intricately wired organ: long projection fibers passing up and down, commissural fibers crossing between hemispheres, and association fibers looping within a hemisphere
o8t.com
.

At the cellular level, each neuron can form thousands of synapses, meaning the network connectivity is extremely dense – the adult human brain contains on the order of $10^{14}$ (hundred trillion) synaptic connections. This complexity, while daunting, also provides redundancy and flexibility. Signals can propagate through multiple pathways; if one route is lost, alternative pathways can often compensate (to a degree). However, connectivity is also highly specific – particular neuronal populations form circuits that execute distinct algorithms (e.g. the thalamocortical loop for sensory gating, or the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit for memory encoding). Ongoing research in connectomics and network neuroscience continues to uncover how connectivity patterns (like motifs, hubs, and communities) correlate with cognitive abilities and how they are altered in diseases.

Neuromodulatory Systems and Neurotransmitter Pathways

Beyond the fast point-to-point wiring of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the brain’s activity is globally shaped by neuromodulatory systems – diffuse networks of neurotransmitter-specific neurons that project widely and broadcast chemical signals to regulate mood, arousal, attention, and learning. The primary modulatory neurotransmitters are dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and acetylcholine, each originating from relatively small nuclei and affecting large swaths of the brain
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. These systems can be thought of as the brain’s volume knobs and reward/punishment signaling pathways, modulating the tone of neural processing across different states.

Dopamine (DA): Dopaminergic neurons are mainly located in the midbrain – specifically the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). From these origins, dopamine is sent along four major pathways
en.wikipedia.org
: (1) the nigrostriatal pathway from SNc to the dorsal striatum (caudate/putamen), crucial for initiating voluntary movement (degeneration here causes Parkinson’s disease); (2) the mesolimbic pathway from VTA to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) and limbic regions, which mediates reward, motivation, and reinforcement learning; (3) the mesocortical pathway from VTA to the prefrontal cortex, influencing cognition, decision-making, and working memory; and (4) the tuberoinfundibular pathway from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland, which regulates hormone release (prolactin inhibition). Dopamine release is associated with reward prediction errors and incentive salience – it teaches the brain which actions or environmental cues are rewarding. It also promotes goal-directed behavior and alertness. In cortical circuits, dopamine often modulates the signal-to-noise ratio, enhancing relevant signals (aided by D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex for focus) and diminishing distracting inputs
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Dysfunction in dopaminergic signaling is implicated in disorders like addiction, schizophrenia, and ADHD, depending on whether the mesolimbic vs. mesocortical pathways are disrupted.

Norepinephrine (NE): Also called noradrenaline, NE is produced by neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC), a blue-tinged nucleus in the pons of the brainstem
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Despite housing only tens of thousands of neurons, the LC projects ubiquitously throughout the CNS – releasing norepinephrine to virtually the entire cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and spinal cord
en.wikipedia.org
. This LC-NE system is the brain’s main arousal and alerting system. When the LC fires, NE levels rise and broadly excite neural activity, increasing alertness and readiness to respond
en.wikipedia.org
. In the cortex, NE can improve signal transmission and plasticity under states of surprise or stress. It plays a key role in the “fight or flight” response – during stress or novel situations, LC activity increases, leading to heightened attention, faster information processing, but potentially also anxiety. Norepinephrine modulates functions ranging from attention (enhancing focus on salient stimuli), memory consolidation (especially for emotionally charged events via interactions with the amygdala), to sleep-wake regulation (LC is mostly silent during REM sleep and most active during waking). Clinically, dysregulation of NE is linked to mood disorders (some antidepressants target NE reuptake), and LC degeneration is seen in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, possibly contributing to cognitive and mood symptoms in those diseases.

Serotonin (5-HT): Serotonergic neurons are mainly found in the raphe nuclei, a chain of nuclei along the midline of the brainstem (in the medulla, pons, and midbrain)
simple.wikipedia.org
. The dorsal raphe nucleus in particular sends extensive projections to the forebrain, including cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia
nature.com
elifesciences.org
. Serotonin has very broad effects on mood, emotion, and modulation of other systems. It is often called the “happiness” neurotransmitter due to its role in mood regulation – low serotonergic activity is associated with depression and anxiety (the target of SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is to increase serotonin levels in synapses)
simple.wikipedia.org
. However, 5-HT’s functions are multifaceted: it contributes to sleep regulation (raphe activity is coupled to sleep stages), appetite, pain perception, and cognitive flexibility. In the cortex, serotonin can promote patience and impulse control by generally damping overly excitatory signals (via 5-HT1A receptors on neurons, for instance). The raphe–cortical system essentially provides a background modulatory tone that biases the brain toward different global states like calmness vs. stress. There are 14+ receptor subtypes for serotonin, which is why its effects can vary from excitatory to inhibitory depending on location. Importantly, the serotonin system is thought to facilitate plasticity – during critical developmental periods, serotonergic fibers innervate the cortex and help sculpt neural circuits; in adults, serotonin can gate plastic changes (e.g. aiding memory formation in the hippocampus). LSD and other psychedelics act on serotonin receptors (like 5-HT2A) to profoundly alter perception, highlighting the powerful role of this system in constructing our sense of reality.

Acetylcholine (ACh): The cholinergic system has two primary origin points: the basal forebrain and the brainstem. In the basal forebrain, the key structure is the nucleus basalis of Meynert (part of a group of nuclei called the basal forebrain cholinergic complex, which also includes the medial septal nuclei and diagonal band of Broca). Cholinergic neurons in nucleus basalis provide the principal source of acetylcholine to the entire cerebral cortex and amygdala
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
 – their axons extensively arborize in the cortex, releasing ACh diffusely to modulate cortical neurons. This basal forebrain cholinergic system is crucial for attention, learning, and memory
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. When you need to focus or when you are learning new information, ACh levels in the cortex rise, promoting a state of cortical excitability and plasticity (for example, by facilitating long-term potentiation in hippocampus and cortex). ACh helps tune the cortex by enhancing responses to afferent input and by activating inhibitory interneurons that sharpen neural selectivity. In essence, acetylcholine can increase the signal-to-noise for neurons processing sensory input, which is why boosting cholinergic function tends to improve attention and memory encoding
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. The other cholinergic source is the brainstem pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, which project ACh to the thalamus and brainstem – these are involved in arousal and REM sleep initiation (the “REM-on” cells are cholinergic). Collectively, the cholinergic systems regulate the sleep-wake cycle and conscious awareness: they are active during waking and REM (dreaming) sleep, and relatively silent during deep non-REM sleep. Degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons is observed in Alzheimer’s disease, contributing to cognitive deficits; hence early Alzheimer’s treatments included acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to boost ACh levels.

These four modulatory systems (DA, NE, 5-HT, ACh) are sometimes termed the diffuse modulatory neurotransmitter systems because each arises from a small set of nuclei but influences the entire brain
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. They do not carry specific sensory or motor information; instead, they broadcast signals that bias the overall mode of processing. For instance, high locus coeruleus firing (NE) sets a brain-wide “alarm” state of alertness
en.wikipedia.org
, while increased basal forebrain ACh might indicate a state of focused attention (enhancing sensory cortical responses). Dopamine bursts signal a rewarding event and promote learning of rewarding actions, whereas serotonin release might indicate satisfaction and discourage impulsive behavior. These systems interact with each other and with fast neurotransmitter systems (glutamate/GABA) to implement complex behaviors. In summary, dopamine modulates reward and motor circuits, norepinephrine modulates arousal and attention, serotonin modulates mood and adaptability, and acetylcholine modulates attention and memory – each through well-defined anatomical pathways (midbrain dopaminergic projections, pontine LC fibers, raphe serotonergic projections, and basal forebrain cholinergic projections) that radiate throughout the brain
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. Understanding these systems has inspired computational models (e.g. reinforcement learning algorithms drawing on dopaminergic reward prediction) and provides insight into pharmacological treatments for many neurological and psychiatric conditions.

Parallels to Artificial Intelligence Modeling

The architecture and function of the human brain have strongly inspired the design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in AI research. Neuroscience-inspired AI typically tries to capture key principles of brain organization – such as hierarchical layered processing, massive parallelism, and feedback loops – to build systems that learn and behave intelligently. Below we highlight several brain features and their influence on AI modeling:

Hierarchical Processing: The brain processes information in a hierarchical manner – for example, in the visual system, simple features (edges, orientations) are extracted in primary visual cortex, and progressively more complex patterns (shapes, objects, scenes) are represented in higher visual areas
numberanalytics.com
. This inspired the multi-layered structure of deep neural networks, where lower layers detect simple features and successive layers build more abstract representations
numberanalytics.com
. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition, for instance, explicitly mimic the hierarchy of visual cortex (with convolutional filters analogous to receptive fields in V1, and deeper layers analogous to IT cortex encoding objects)
numberanalytics.com
. Indeed, optimized deep networks have been shown to develop representations that quantitatively resemble those in primate visual cortex, aligning layer depth with the cortical hierarchy
nature.com
. Beyond vision, hierarchical models are used in speech and language (e.g. phonemes to words to semantics) – reflecting how the brain’s language areas build up from sounds to meaning. This layered approach allows complex functions to emerge from simpler units, a concept directly borrowed from cortical layer and area organization.

Massive Parallelism and Distributed Processing: Unlike traditional computers which execute instructions serially, the brain conducts many operations in parallel – billions of neurons fire simultaneously in distributed networks. This motivates AI systems to utilize parallel computing (e.g. GPUs, TPUs) and distributed representations where information is encoded across many units rather than a single locus. In ANNs, knowledge is stored as patterns of weights across many connections, analogous to how the brain stores memories in synapse ensembles. The brain’s ability to integrate activity from specialized modules (vision, audition, motor, etc.) in parallel has inspired architectures that run multiple subnetworks concurrently and then fuse their outputs (as in multi-modal AI systems that combine vision and language). The concept of dropout and redundancy in neural nets – where no single unit’s failure ruins the performance – is reminiscent of brain networks where many neurons contribute to a function in a fault-tolerant way. Massive parallelism also underlies the brain’s speed: cognitive processes can be completed in a few hundred milliseconds because many computations are done simultaneously across different levels. AI has increasingly embraced parallel processing to achieve real-time performance, moving away from strictly sequential logic. For example, spiking neural network models explicitly simulate many neurons firing in parallel and event-based computing, directly taking inspiration from how the brain’s neural pulses work collectively.

Recurrent Connections and Feedback Loops: Biological neural circuits are recurrent – they contain loops that allow information to reverberate over time (e.g. sustaining working memory or implementing feedback control). Early AI models were mostly feedforward, but more advanced models incorporate recurrent networks (RNNs) and feedback connections. The brain’s use of feedback is seen in cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, cortico-cortical feedback (e.g. higher visual areas sending predictions back to lower ones), and local recurrent loops for attractor states
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. This inspired AI architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and transformer networks with self-attention, which maintain state over time or allow later processing stages to influence earlier ones (analogous to feedback attention highlights in vision). Feedback loops in the brain also perform error correction (as in predictive coding: higher levels send a prediction and lower areas return a prediction error). AI training algorithms like backpropagation can be seen as implementing a form of feedback error correction across layers – albeit the brain likely doesn’t do it in the same way, the concept of propagating error signals to adjust connections has biological resonance in reward-modulated plasticity or dendritic error signals. Moreover, attention mechanisms in AI (e.g. in vision transformers or attention-based NLP models) are loosely analogous to how the brain’s attentional feedback (via frontal and parietal signals) highlights certain features of sensory input. By reweighting connections dynamically, these AI models mimic the brain’s ability to contextually gate information flow.

Modularity and Specialized Subnetworks: The brain contains specialized areas (visual cortex, auditory cortex, etc.) that are highly optimized for certain data, but they all interconnect to enable multi-modal understanding. Similarly, AI is moving towards modular networks – for instance, separate networks handling vision vs. language that then merge (like in image captioning systems). The notion of expert networks and mixture-of-experts models in AI draws from the brain’s modular organization where different circuits are tuned to different tasks. Additionally, generative models in AI (like GANs or variational autoencoders) take inspiration from how the brain can run in generative mode (dreaming, imagining) using internal models of the world – essentially the DMN and higher cortices simulating scenarios, akin to an AI model generating plausible data.

Learning and Plasticity Mechanisms: The brain learns by adjusting synaptic strengths through activity-dependent plasticity (often summarized by “neurons that fire together, wire together”). This inspired the fundamental Hebbian learning rule used in many unsupervised learning algorithms and older connectionist AI. Modern deep learning’s gradient descent is not the same as biology, but there is ongoing research into more brain-like learning rules (such as local learning rules, spike-timing-dependent plasticity implementations, etc.). Reinforcement learning (RL) in AI – where an agent explores and is guided by reward signals – was directly influenced by understanding of the dopaminergic reward system in the brain. The temporal difference learning algorithm used in RL corresponds to reward prediction error signals similar to dopamine bursts

. Concepts like eligibility traces and neuromodulatory gating in AI algorithms borrow from how neuromodulators (dopamine, acetylcholine) gate plasticity in the brain during learning of tasks. Even the idea of dropout in training (randomly turning off neurons to prevent overfitting) has been compared to how the brain might reduce correlations and encourage robustness, perhaps akin to random neuronal noise or stochastic release processes in synapses.

In sum, many aspects of neural network design and training have been and continue to be informed by neuroscience. The hierarchical, multilayer structure of deep networks came from the brain’s visual hierarchy

; the use of parallel distributed processing was inspired by neuronal population coding; the incorporation of recurrent loops and attention was driven by understanding cognitive feedback and working memory in the brain. This exchange is reciprocal – just as the brain inspires AI, artificial models provide hypotheses for how ensembles of neurons could be computing. Today’s cutting-edge AI like deep convolutional networks, recurrent sequence models, and attention mechanisms can be viewed as high-level abstractions of neural principles. Researchers continue to look at the brain for new ideas – for example, investigating how the brain achieves efficient unsupervised learning (to inspire unsupervised AI), or how cortical circuits might implement algorithms equivalent to backpropagation. Conversely, neuroscientists use deep learning models as computational metaphors to interpret brain imaging data, aligning artificial layer activations to brain region activations
