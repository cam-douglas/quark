# Core Systems - AGI Foundation Components

This folder contains the foundational AGI systems that provide the core intelligence capabilities.

## Contents

### 1. Small Mind Core (`small_mind_core.py`)
- **Source**: `agi_core/reasoning/small_mind.py`
- **Purpose**: Core integration layer that brings together multi-model training, neuro connectome analysis, exponential learning, and agent hub
- **Features**: Multi-modal conversation, continuous learning, pattern synthesis, code analysis, multi-model routing

### 2. Unified Intelligence System (`unified_intelligence_system.py`)
- **Source**: `unified_intelligence_system.py`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive system that combines all agents, models, and training capabilities into one continuously learning AI
- **Features**: Autonomous operation, continuous learning, knowledge synthesis, performance evaluation

### 3. Unified Super Mind (`unified_super_mind.py`)
- **Source**: `src/smallmind/unified_super_mind.py`
- **Purpose**: Single trainable model that integrates all Small-Mind capabilities with MOE backbones and child-like learning
- **Features**: MOE architecture, child-like learning, neuroscience integration, continuous training

### 4. Terminal Agent (`terminal_agent.py`)
- **Source**: `neuro/terminal_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Intelligent terminal assistant with dependency detection, environment management, and smart auto-activation
- **Features**: Dependency scanning, version checking, environment management, enhanced UI

### 5. Agent Hub (`agent_hub.py`)
- **Source**: `agent_hub/cli.py`
- **Purpose**: Central hub for managing and coordinating multiple AI agents
- **Features**: Agent registration, routing, coordination, communication

## Usage

These core systems provide the foundation for building advanced AGI applications. Each system can be used independently or integrated together for comprehensive AI capabilities.

## Integration

The core systems are designed to work together:
1. **Small Mind Core** provides the reasoning foundation
2. **Unified Intelligence System** orchestrates all components
3. **Unified Super Mind** provides the trainable model architecture
4. **Terminal Agent** handles system interaction and management
5. **Agent Hub** coordinates multiple specialized agents
