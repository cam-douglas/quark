# 🌐 UNIVERSAL DOMAIN DATABASE - SELF-LEARNING KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM

## Overview
This database directory contains a comprehensive collection of all known domains to humankind, organized for self-learning and exponential knowledge growth. The system automatically scours open-source datasets and generates synthetic data to continuously expand its knowledge base.

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Domain Taxonomy**: Hierarchical classification of all human knowledge domains
- **Self-Learning Engine**: AI-powered system that learns from new data sources
- **Synthetic Data Generator**: Creates new datasets based on learned patterns
- **Internet Scraper**: Automatically discovers and ingests open-source datasets
- **Knowledge Graph**: Interconnected representation of domain relationships

### Learning Capabilities
- **Exponential Growth**: Knowledge expands exponentially as the model gains experience
- **Cross-Domain Integration**: Discovers connections between different fields
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies underlying patterns across domains
- **Synthetic Generation**: Creates new knowledge through inference and synthesis

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize the system**: Run `python database/init_system.py`
2. **Start learning**: Execute `python database/start_learning.py`
3. **Monitor progress**: Check `database/analytics/learning_metrics.json`

## Current Status
- **Domains Cataloged**: 0 (initializing)
- **Datasets Integrated**: 2 (COPASI - biochemical networks, Allen Brain Map - neuroscience)
- **Learning Mode**: Active
- **Synthetic Data Generated**: 0

## Contributing
This system is designed to be self-maintaining and self-expanding. The AI will automatically discover new domains and datasets as it learns.
