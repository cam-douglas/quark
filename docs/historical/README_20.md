# Unified Super Mind

The **Unified Super Mind** is a complete integration of all Small-Mind components into one trainable, unified AI system. This system combines multiple AI capabilities and learning mechanisms into a single model that can learn, adapt, and evolve continuously.

## 🧠 What It Combines

### 1. **MOE (Mixture of Experts) Architecture**
- Multiple specialized neural networks (experts)
- Intelligent routing system to direct information to appropriate experts
- Scalable architecture that can handle diverse tasks

### 2. **Child-Like Learning Mechanisms**
- **Curiosity-driven exploration**: The model learns to be curious about new information
- **Emotional learning**: Integrates emotional responses into learning processes
- **Exploration vs. exploitation**: Balances trying new things with using what works

### 3. **Neuroscience-Inspired Processing**
- **Brain development stages**: Simulates neural development from simple to complex
- **Synaptic plasticity**: Connections strengthen or weaken based on usage
- **Memory consolidation**: Important information is retained and integrated

### 4. **Continuous Learning & Meta-Learning**
- **Adaptive learning**: The model learns how to learn more effectively
- **Memory bank**: Stores and retrieves important information
- **Lifelong learning**: Continuously improves without forgetting previous knowledge

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually
pip install torch transformers numpy datasets
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.smallmind.unified import UnifiedSuperMind, SuperMindConfig, SuperMindTrainer

# Create configuration
config = SuperMindConfig(
    base_model="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium",
    num_experts=4,
    learning_rate=1e-4,
    batch_size=4,
    max_steps=1000
)

# Create model
model = UnifiedSuperMind(config)

# Generate responses
response = model.generate_response("Hello, how are you?")
print(response)
```

### Training

```python
# Create trainer
trainer = SuperMindTrainer(model, config)

# Train on your data
trainer.train(train_dataset, val_dataset, save_dir="./checkpoints")

# Save and load models
trainer.save_model("./checkpoints", "my_model")
trainer.load_model("./checkpoints/my_model")
```
