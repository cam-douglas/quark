### **‚öôÔ∏è Technical Rules**
- **`technical/technicalrules.md`** - Technical specifications and implementation rules
- **`technical/cloud_computing_rules.md`** - Cloud computing specifications and rules
- **`technical/testing_protocol.md`** - Testing protocols and procedures

### **üß† Brain Simulation Rules**
- **`brain_simulation/brain-simulation-rules.mdc`** - Technical brain simulation details

- **`ml_workflow/testing_validation_rules.md`** - Testing protocols and validation systems
- **`ml_workflow/multi_model_validation_protocol.md`** - Multi-model validation protocols

## üéØ How to Use These Rules

### **For Development:**
1. **Start with `general/rules_general.md`** for core behavioral guidelines
2. **Check `security/rules_security.md`** for security requirements
3. **Reference `technical/technicalrules.md`** for implementation details
4. **Use `brain_simulation/`** rules for neural architecture work
5. **Follow `ml_workflow/`** rules for machine learning tasks

### **For Code Review:**
- All code must comply with the relevant rules
- Security rules are mandatory and cannot be overridden
- Technical rules provide implementation standards
- Brain simulation rules ensure architectural consistency

### **For Automation:**
- The automation scripts reference these rules
- Rules are used to determine file organization
- Compliance checking is automated where possible

## üîÑ Rules Updates

### **When to Update Rules:**
- New architectural patterns are introduced
- Security requirements change
- Technical standards evolve
- Brain simulation architecture is modified

### **How to Update Rules:**
1. Modify the appropriate rule file
2. Update the MASTER_INDEX.md if adding new rules
3. Test the changes with automation scripts
4. Document the changes in the rules changelog

## üìã Rules Compliance

### **Automated Compliance:**
- **File Organization**: Automated scripts enforce file placement rules
- **Security Checks**: Automated security scanning and validation
- **Architecture Validation**: Automated checking of brain simulation patterns
- **Testing Requirements**: Automated enforcement of testing protocols

### **Manual Compliance:**
- **Code Review**: Developers must review against relevant rules
- **Architecture Review**: Brain simulation changes require architectural review
- **Security Review**: All changes must pass security review
- **Documentation**: All changes must be documented according to rules

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Read `general/rules_general.md`** for core guidelines
2. **Check `security/rules_security.md`** for security requirements
3. **Review `technical/technicalrules.md`** for implementation standards
4. **Use appropriate specialized rules** for your domain
5. **Run automation scripts** to ensure compliance

## üìû Support

For questions about rules or compliance:
- Check the relevant rule file first
- Review the MASTER_INDEX.md for cross-references
- Consult the automation scripts for implementation details
- Contact the project maintainers for clarification
