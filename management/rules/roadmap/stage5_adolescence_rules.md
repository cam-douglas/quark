*Stage 5 - Adolescence* 

**Version 2.1 – 2025-09-01**

> **Canonical** – This file supersedes all earlier Stage 5 roadmaps. 

## Adolescence — Pruning & neuromodulatory maturation consolidating executive function.

Adolescence (~12–20 yr): pruning, neuromodulator maturation, and final myelination consolidate executive, reward, and abstract reasoning circuits.

**Roadmap Status:** 📋 Planned

Adolescence (~12–20 years) finalizes cortical pruning, strengthens long-range connectivity, and sees peak dopaminergic and serotonergic remodeling, underpinning reward sensitivity and cognitive flexibility.

**Engineering Milestones — implementation tasks driving Stage 5 goals**
* [multi-scale-integration] Continue multi-scale-integration P1: finalize synaptic pruning to ~50 % peak while ensuring stability via OGD constraints.
* [functional-networks] Launch functional-networks P0: DMN/SN/DAN switching controller with salience-gated task sets.
* [neuromodulatory-systems] Mature neuromodulatory-systems P2: receptor-level tuning for DA, NE, 5-HT, ACh based on reward and flexibility assays.
* [planning-agents] Deploy hierarchical RL planner (Hier-PPO + curiosity) over fronto-striatal loops; validate on Stroop and WCST tasks.
* [developmental-biology] Load gene-marker table (NeuN, GFAP, OLIG2, IBA1) and synaptic proteome annotations into connectome metadata.
* [metabolic-constraints] Implement energy metabolism layer (glucose/ketone switch & astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle) influencing training-time robustness metrics.
* [vascular-placeholder] Prepare perfusion monitoring hooks for upcoming vascular model integration in Stage 6.

**Biological Goals — desired biological outcomes for Stage 5**

* [graph-pruning] Complete synaptic pruning to achieve adult sparsity (~50% of peak synapses). **(KPI: pruning_completion_pct)**
* [neuromodulatory-systems] Mature neuromodulatory systems (DA, NE, 5-HT, ACh) with receptor-level tuning. **(KPI: neuromod_tuning_pct)**
* [planning-agents] Optimize fronto-striatal loops for goal-directed planning and risk evaluation. **(KPI: risk_adjusted_return)**
* [evaluation] Validate reward-learning curves and cognitive control tasks (Stroop, WCST). **(KPI: stroop_accuracy)**
* [developmental-biology] Integrate gene-expression markers (NeuN, GFAP, OLIG2, IBA1) for cell-type tagging across cortex and subcortex. **(KPI: gene_marker_coverage_pct)**
* [proteomics] Annotate synaptic proteome (SNARE, PSD-95, synaptophysin) to inform plasticity kinetics. **(KPI: proteome_annotation_pct)**

**SOTA ML Practices (2025)**
* [planning-agents] Reinforcement learning with curiosity + uncertainty bonuses (InfoBarlow).
* [large-models] Large-scale MoE transformers fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization.
* [continual-learning] Continual learning with orthogonal gradient descent to prevent forgetting while pruning.
* [self-critique] Self-critique agents to iteratively refine decision policies.
