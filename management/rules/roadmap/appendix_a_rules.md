Core Cognitive Domains

Neurobiology
Episodic memory relies on hippocampus (DG/CA3 for pattern separation/completion) with cortical consolidation during slow-wave sleep; acetylcholine gates encoding vs consolidation across hippocampal-entorhinal loops. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports working memory and executive control, integrating with thalamus via cortico-thalamo-cortical loops; cortex obeys laminar feedforward (L4‚ÜíL2/3) and feedback (L5/6) motifs. Reasoning benefits from hybrid neural-symbolic processing layered over these substrates. 


Implication for Design
Implement hippocampal episodic store + cortical semantic graph; use cholinergic mode switches for encode/retrieve policies; PFC-gated working memory; hybrid neuro-symbolic stack for reasoning and proof search.

Perception & World Modeling

Neurobiology
Cortex organizes perception via hierarchical predictive coding: feedback conveys predictions; feedforward conveys prediction errors; thalamo-cortical loops update beliefs under uncertainty. Attention uses partially segregated DAN (goal-driven, intraparietal/superior frontal) and VAN (stimulus-driven, right-lateralized temporo-parietal), while the Salience Network (anterior insula + dACC) allocates control and mediates network switching. The DMN supports internal simulation and autobiographical/world-model inferences. 

Annual Reviews

Implication for Design
Adopt predictive world models with uncertainty quantification; cross-modal fusion guided by attention controllers (DAN/VAN emulation) and a salience-driven switch. DMN-like background simulation supports counterfactuals and planning.

Action & Agency 

Neurobiology
Goal-directed behavior emerges from cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. Dopamine neurons encode reward prediction error that trains striatal policies (direct/indirect pathways), mapping closely to actor‚Äìcritic learning: dopamine RPEs update the critic; dopamine-dependent plasticity updates the actor. The cerebellum provides forward models for predictive control and contributes to cognition and affect (CCAS), tuning timing and error correction across cognitive/motor domains. PFC orchestrates multi-step plans; thalamus gates cortical working sets; SN (dACC/insula) modulates effort and task set switching. 


Implication for Design
Use hierarchical RL with options (SMDP); actor‚Äìcritic with model-based planning (MCTS) and cerebellar-like forward models; risk/effort costs learned from salience-weighted signals.

Communication & Language 

Neurobiology
Language engages distributed fronto-temporo-parietal networks superimposed on hierarchical cortical microcircuits. Conscious access to linguistic content is well modeled by the Global Neuronal Workspace: information becomes widely broadcast across long-range fronto-parietal hubs (late P3/LPC signatures) enabling cross-module manipulation (e.g., reasoning, planning). Predictive coding explains rapid context integration and ambiguity resolution via top-down expectations. 


Implication for Design
Adopt a GNW-like ‚ÄúConductor‚Äù that broadcasts verified language states to specialists; hybrid neural-symbolic parsing; memory-augmented discourse tracking.

Social & Cultural Intelligence 

Neurobiology
Theory of Mind (ToM) consistently recruits medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral TPJ, supporting belief attribution across tasks. Moral/evaluative choices engage ventromedial PFC with contributions from limbic circuits; vmPFC damage alters moral judgments, highlighting its role in integrating social value with outcome evaluation. Salience and control networks coordinate social attention and conflict monitoring. 


Implication for Design

<a id="$cap-6-metacognition"></a>

Metacognition & Self-Modeling 

Neurobiology
Metacognition draws on fronto-parietal workspaces to represent confidence/uncertainty and to select goals. Predictive coding / free-energy principles provide a normative account: the system monitors model evidence and minimizes expected surprise via action/perception updates; GNW broadcasting explains access to introspective reports. 


Implication for Design

```


<a id="$cap-7-knowledge-integration"></a>

Knowledge Integration 
Neurobiology
The brain exhibits small-world topology with clustered hubs enabling efficient integration across domains; long-range association areas support abstraction and multi-modal binding (DMN, fronto-parietal). Such architectures optimize integration-vs-cost trade-offs. 


Implication for Design

Neurobiology ‚Üí Engineering Pragmatics
To sustain whole-brain scale and continuous learning, the platform must be modular (mirroring segregated but integrated brain networks), scalable (distributed compute akin to parallel cortical columns), safe (multi-layer control like neuromodulatory gating), and measurable (as in neurophysiology, with rich telemetry). Predictive coding/GNW suggest explicit verification and broadcast layers for safe, auditable operation.
