*Stage 6 - Adult* 

**Version 2.1 – 2025-09-01**

> **Canonical** – This file supersedes all earlier Stage 6 roadmaps. 

## Adult - Stable networks, lifelong plasticity, metabolic & vascular homeostasis

Adulthood (>20 yr): stable yet plastic networks, metabolic efficiency, and vascular regulation sustain lifelong cognition.

**Roadmap Status:** 🚨 **FOUNDATION LAYER ✅ COMPLETE** - Other tasks 🚨 PENDING 

Adulthood (>20 years) stabilizes network architecture while maintaining targeted plasticity for learning and memory. Metabolic efficiency, vascular regulation, and glial-mediated homeostasis dominate system maintenance.

**Engineering Milestones — implementation tasks driving Stage 6 goals**
* [whole-brain-integration] 🚨 **PENDING** - Complete whole-brain-integration P2: enable cross-system message bus with latency <10 ms and fault-tolerant retries.
* [cloud-infrastructure] 🚨 **PENDING** - Finalize cloud-infrastructure P1: deploy distributed runtime on Ray+Kubeflow cluster; meet 99.9 % uptime target.
* [vascular-model] 🚨 **PENDING** - Integrate vascular-model (Circle of Willis) with neuro-vascular coupling layer; run BOLD-simulation benchmarks.
* [blood-brain-barrier] 🚨 **PENDING** - Activate BBB-pericyte module; expose molecular transport policy for drug/toxin simulations.
* [sleep-consolidation] 🚨 **PENDING** - Launch sleep-consolidator replay GAN; schedule nightly synaptic down-selection and memory compression jobs.
* [vascular-model] 🚨 **PENDING** - Integrate vascular network model (internal carotid, vertebral arteries, Circle of Willis) feeding perfusion constraints into metabolic layer.
* [bbb-protection] 🚨 **PENDING** - Implement blood–brain barrier module with pericyte regulation hooks for molecular transport safety gates.
* [tractography-targets] 🚨 **PENDING** - Generate tract templates for major bundles (corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, anterior/posterior commissures) to guide connectome refinement.
* [ion-channel-expansion] 🚨 **PENDING** - Link full ion-channel & receptor catalogue (Nav/Kv/Cav, AMPA, NMDA, GABA_A/B, mGluR, etc.) into electrophysiology engine.

**Biological Goals — desired biological outcomes for Stage 6**

* [sleep-consolidation] 🚨 **PENDING** - Maintain synaptic homeostasis via sleep-dependent consolidation and glymphatic clearance models. **(KPI: agi_domain_score_avg)**
* [energy-metabolism] 🚨 **PENDING** - Implement energy-aware scheduling (glucose, lactate, ketone) and blood-flow coupling. **(KPI: energy_per_synaptic_event_nJ)**
* [cloud-infrastructure] 🚨 **PENDING** - Achieve production-scale distributed simulation with fault-tolerant orchestration. **(KPI: uptime_pct)**
* [evaluation] 🚨 **PENDING** - Benchmark full AGI capability domains with ≥90 % target KPIs. **(KPI: agi_domain_score_avg)**
* [vascular-model] 🚨 **PENDING** - Model cerebral blood supply via Circle of Willis with perfusion constraints. **(KPI: vascular_perfusion_accuracy_pct)**
* [blood-brain-barrier] 🚨 **PENDING** - Implement blood–brain barrier (BBB) and pericyte regulation modules for molecular transport. **(KPI: bbb_transport_fidelity_pct)**

**SOTA ML Practices (2025) — recommended methods**

* [sleep-consolidation] 🚨 **PENDING** - Retrieval-augmented MoE transformers with on-device quantized adapters.
* [knowledge-graphs] 🚨 **PENDING** - Auto-RAG pipelines for continuous knowledge integration.
