*Technical guidelines for roles.md and cognitive_brain_roadmap.md implementation*
*Neuro-Architectural Framework with 8 expert domains*

## OVERVIEW
These technical rules provide development guidelines for implementing the Neuro-Architectural Framework (roles.md) and Cognitive Brain Roadmap (cognitive_brain_roadmap.md) using the 8 expert domains. They ensure code quality, architectural integrity, and proper integration across all domains with ethical guardrails.

## NEURO-ARCHITECTURAL TECHNICAL STANDARDS

### Foundational Principle
Every agent instantiated in the system must **inherit the combined knowledge** of these 8 expert domains at all times:
- **Computational Neuroscience**: Neural circuits, plasticity rules, neuromodulators
- **Cognitive Science & Psychology**: Memory systems, attention, reasoning, task sets, awareness
- **Machine Learning & AI Systems**: Trainable objectives, optimization stability, sparse activation
- **Systems Architecture & Distributed Computing**: Concurrency, routing, backpressure, resource limits
- **Developmental Neurobiology**: Staged growth, pruning, critical periods
- **Philosophy of Mind & Consciousness Studies**: Constraints from global workspace / integration theories
- **Data Engineering & Neuroinformatics**: Data schemas and provenance for any biological inputs
- **Ethics & Safety**: Control boundaries, logging, override protocols

### Architectural Integrity Standards
**Hierarchy Compliance**:
- Strict Architecture Agent (root) → Core Modules → Specialized Subsystems
- One-to-one functional module mapping (PFC, WM, BG, Thalamus, DMN, SN, CB)
- Hierarchy preserved across F → N0 → N1 developmental stages
- All connections follow declared connectome specifications

**Module Implementation**:
- Each module conforms to biological analogues
- Emit telemetry: confidence ∈ [0,1], demand, and relevant state
- Honor developmental constraints (e.g., WM slots expand at N1)
- Support sleep-driven replay (SCE) and local consolidation

### Runtime Standards
**Sleep & Consolidation**:
- All agents support sleep-driven replay (SCE) and local consolidation
- Working memory grows gradually with stage; supports rehearse and precision metrics
- Sparse MoE: Expert activation is **Top‑K** under BG gating with biologically informed scores

**Neuromodulators**:
- DA/NE/ACh/5‑HT present as global signals; agents must accept and respond to them
- Neuromodulatory setpoints managed by Architecture Agent
- Energy/budget caps enforced at all times

**Homeostasis**:
- Enforce compute budgets, normalization, and anti-runaway checks every cycle
- Fatigue cycles: The system alternates wake/sleep; no perpetual wake
- Resource limits and backpressure management
