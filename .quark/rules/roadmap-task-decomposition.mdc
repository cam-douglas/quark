description: Quark roadmap task decomposition
alwaysApply: true
---
ALWAYS apply every rule across all Cursor rule (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) and Quark rule (`.quark/rules/*.mdc`) files to the **current codebase and all future changes**; if any existing file violates a rule, refactor it or document an exception before proceeding.
### ðŸ§¬ BIOLOGICALLY COMPLIANT ROADMAP TASK DECOMPOSITION

ALWAYS break every roadmap **Task** (or higher-level Objective/Epic) into **10â€“20 biologically compliant Sub-Tasks** that collectively satisfy the parent goal.  Each Sub-Task MUST:

1. Represent a discrete, testable unit of biological or computational work (e.g., "simulate gene-regulatory network for limb bud", "validate protein-ligand docking scores against benchmark dataset").
2. Maintain clear lineage to its parent Task, using the Phase â–¸ Objective â–¸ Task numbering convention (e.g., "Phase 2â–¸Batch Bâ–¸Task 7-Sub 3").
3. Include explicit success-criteria grounded in quantitative or literature-supported biological metrics (e.g., accuracy â‰¥ 95 % vs in-vivo data, RMSD â‰¤ 2 Ã…).
4. Specify required datasets, models, or wet-lab validations, and cite sources or protocols where applicable.
5. Adhere to all existing global rules (architecture, testing, documentation, performance, safety).

#### Enforcement

â€¢ The planning pipeline MUST refuse to mark a Task as *defined* until exactly 10â€“20 compliant Sub-Tasks are listed.
â€¢ CI pipelines MUST validate that every roadmap YAML (`tasks_*`) and generated `chat_tasks.yaml` obey this decomposition before merging.
â€¢ Any deviation (fewer than 10 or more than 20 Sub-Tasks, or missing biological linkage) triggers a blocking error labelled `BIO-DECOMP-VIOLATION`.

#### Rationale

Granular, biologically contextualised sub-tasks ensure scientific rigour, parallelisability, and traceability of deliverables, reducing integration risk and enabling fine-grained scheduling across multidisciplinary teams.### ðŸ§¬ BIOLOGICALLY COMPLIANT ROADMAP TASK DECOMPOSITION
