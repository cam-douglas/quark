alwaysApply: true

ALWAYS apply every rule across all Cursor rule (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) and Quark rule (`.quark/rules/*.mdc`) files to the **current codebase and all future changes**; if any existing file violates a rule, refactor it or document an exception before proceeding.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Safety & Emergency Compliance
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALWAYS pre-load the following safety-critical modules and documents at session
 start to ensure all code changes respect shutdown / guardrail logic:
  • `management/emergency/emergency_control.py`
  • `management/emergency/emergency_shutdown_system.py`
  • `brain/architecture/safety/safety_guardian.py`
  • `docs/safety_officer_readme.md`  (links must be kept up-to-date)
  • `docs/SCIENTIFIC_ENHANCEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

ALWAYS update relative links inside `docs/safety_officer_readme.md` whenever
 file paths change.
