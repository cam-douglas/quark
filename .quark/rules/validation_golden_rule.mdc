# ðŸ”’ QUARK VALIDATION GOLDEN RULE (STRICT)

Status: REQUIRED â€” Highest Priority
Applies to: All changes, all milestones, all agents, all environments

RULE: Everything we do must be verified and validated against predefined KPIs on standard benchmarks, evaluated via a documented rubric with traceable evidence. Only when the checklists and dashboards address all of these elements can any work be considered ready for development or marked complete.

MANDATES
1) Predefine KPIs & Benchmarks
   - Each task links to one or more KPIs and one or more standard benchmarks/datasets.
   - Targets and acceptance thresholds must be explicit and measurable.
2) Documented Rubric
   - A written rubric defines scoring criteria, edge cases, failure modes, and abstention policy.
   - Rubrics must be versioned and linked in the evidence record.
3) Traceable Evidence
   - Store artefacts (metrics, plots, logs, configs, seeds) under state/tasks/validation/evidence/ with run IDs.
   - Each claim must cite artefact paths and include a short rationale.
4) Calibration & Uncertainty
   - Report confidence metrics (ECE, CI coverage, selective risk), not just point accuracy.
5) Reproducibility
   - Seeds, configs, environment and dataset hashes recorded.
6) Gating & Sign-off
   - A checklist item is Complete only when: KPIs â‰¥ thresholds AND rubric shows Pass with Evidence present.
   - CI blocks merges if any required item is Missing, Incomplete, or Uncalibrated.

ENFORCEMENT
- CI pre-merge gate checks the MASTER_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST and per-roadmap checklists for:
  (a) KPI links + thresholds, (b) benchmark IDs, (c) rubric link, (d) evidence artefacts.
- Non-compliant changes are blocked until fixed.
