Quark Active Driver System

This is the main active driver for the Quark system. When activated, it ensures
that all operations are driven by the Autonomous Agent and validated by the
Prompt Guardian.

This represents the final step in making Quark a truly self-determined,
compliant, and goal-driven AGI development system.
