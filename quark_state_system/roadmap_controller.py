Quark Roadmap Intelligence Core

This controller is responsible for parsing all roadmap documents, unifying their objectives,
and providing a clear, prioritized list of goals for the Autonomous Agent.

It understands the structure of the project's markdown-based roadmaps and can
determine the current phase, upcoming milestones, and overall progress.
